## Audience
Whose problems are we trying to solve?<br>
<ul>Mentally ill people in particular, but it affects the general public as well (since the chance of getting mentally ill can be as high as ~10% in Singapore, you never know when/who might be affected)</ul>

## Problems
What problems are people facing?
<ul>Lack of awareness of mental illness, including misconceptions/misunderstandings about causes, symptoms and treatment for different kinds of disorders/illnesses, as well as stigma like mentally ill people are weak and dangerous or can just snap out of it if they really tried </ul>
How are these already being solved?<br><br>
<ul>→ already there are campaigns raising awareness on mental illness, but they don’t always have a very large target group / reach
→ many mentally ill do not know/believe that they have a disorder or what disorder they have
→ if more people around them can tell, they can get help and support more easily
→ if misunderstandings about mental illness can be corrected, stigma will be lessened and there will be less shame around being mentally ill</ul>

## Solution
