# iCube™
## pls approve this thenk

* The perfect fidget cube remote controller, tailored just for you
* For use with both phone and computer, but optimised for computer 
* A scroller to scroll up and down a webpage
* Up/down/left/right buttons
* Roller ball (3D spheric mouse) to act as a mouse - only works for computer
* Button that doubles as a select (left-click) button for computer and home button for phone
* Music control buttons - play/pause, volume control
* Button to enable bluetooth for pairing with devices
* When one button is being used, all the others are disabled (so it’s okay if the user accidentally presses other buttons)
* When not connected to any device, it acts as a fidget cube
* Optimised for reading, using browsers, and listening to music
* Maybe it can also be a speaker and have a microphone for voice commands (linking to Siri maybe) - probably not possible to pack into so compact a cube though

## Audience
Whose problems are we trying to solve?<br>
<ul>Regular users of phones and computers, presenters, people who like to fidget.</ul>

## Problems
What problems are people facing?
<ul>More and more people are using their phones and computers for longer and longer periods of time, which often cause problems such as neck ache, bad posture, cramping etc. Hence, our solution aims to allow people to sit in any position, not having to hold their device, and still be able to control their devices with a few simple but key features - scrolling (for reading), or volume control buttons (for listening to music).<br><br>
 
This can also be used as a clicker for people presenting using their computer and a projector, but not just for Powerpoint slides, who may wish to pace around the room or stand away from their computers to better engage their audience. It can also be useful for collaboration, when more than one person is using a single computer at the same time - say, while one person is typing on the computer, another can scroll using our functional fidget cube.
 
The recent popularity of the fidget cube has also shown that fidgeting is really something that a lot of people like to do, and that many people want to be able to fidget without annoying others. Packaging our solution in a similar form doubles its functionality - it can act as a remote controller to electronic devices, as well as a fidget cube when it’s not connected to any device.</ul> 

## Solution
What’s your solution, in one sentence? 
Can you find an analogy to describe it? 
<ul>It’s a fidget cube crossed with a remote controller.</ul>

## Assumptions
What assumptions are we making that the project depends on?
<ul>We are assuming that people are as lazy and sedentary as we are. And that they experience discomfort/cramps/aches from holding their devices in one position for too long as we do.</ul>

## Unique Selling Point
Our version will succeed because
<ul>It can be used as a fidget cube when not connected to any devices.<br><br>
Also, it’s minimalistic - just a few key features optimised for reading and listening to music, plus a button to connect to Bluetooth. (Though there’s the additional roller mouse and select button for computers.)
